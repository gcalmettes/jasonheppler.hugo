### Hi. I'm Jason.

I am the Academic Technology Specialist in the [Department of History](http://history.stanford.edu/) at [Stanford University](http://stanford.edu/), where I collaborate with faculty and graduate students on digital history research, teaching, and publishing. Most of my work focuses on data visualization, humanities design, and digital and spatial history. I write here regularly on [my blog](/blog/), contribute to the [BlogWest](http://blogwest.org/) group blog, and co-host [The First Draft](http://www.fiddly.fm/firstdraft/) podcast and [Overanalyze](http://www.fiddly.fm/overanalyze/) podcast.

I am a 20th century U.S. historian specializing in environmental, the North American West, and digital and public history. I am currently working on a book manuscript titled Machines in the Valley: Community, Urban Change, and Environmental Politics in Silicon Valley. The book describes the emergence of the Silicon Valley as a political project closely tied to the region's environment, while also charting a story of "nature" becoming a central political issue. I'll have more [information about my manuscript](http://notebook.jasonheppler.org/machines-valley-manuscript/) in my [Open History Notebook](http://notebook.jasonheppler.org/) where I keep notes and research material for various projects.
