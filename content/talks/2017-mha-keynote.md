Can digital maps revitalize and enhance the study of the American Midwest? Using a project developed in partnership with the Midwestern History Association, Dr. Jason A. Heppler will discuss the role of digital maps in overcoming the limitations of print maps, and how such maps can be used for historical research, teaching, and public engagement. Despite the continued interest in regions and historical atlases devoted to telling regional histories, none have been published about the Midwest. Digital mapmaking can be a corrective to the paucity of Midwestern space and place.
