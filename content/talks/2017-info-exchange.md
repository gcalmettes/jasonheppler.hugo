Digital technology has become a key component of public history and cultural heritage, from mobile devices, Geographic Information Systems, 3D modeling, augmented reality, and online exhibits. This session will address the ways digital technologies can heighten civic engagement and activism as well as engage communities in creating their histories. Case studies of two community engagement projects will highlight the drawbacks and benefits to using digital techniques in community engagement and emphasize how such approaches can empower communities to tell their stories and experiences.
