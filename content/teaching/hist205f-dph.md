This is a hands-on course that introduces students to the intersections of digital history and public history to serve the needs of academic and non-academic audiences. Digital environments such as social media, blogs, exhibits, digital collections and archives, and mobile applications are changing the ways historians interact with their publics. This course introduces theories and methods of digital history and public history, including designing digital exhibits, describing and publishing digital collections, mobile computing, shared authority, and methods for evaluating public history.
