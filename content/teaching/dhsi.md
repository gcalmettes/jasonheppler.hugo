The visualization of historical and literary data has become a common practice in digital humanities, drawing on older traditions of visualizing in these disciplines. A variety of out-of-the-box tools exist for easily jumping in to data and information visualization, but when we use these tools we run the risk of research questions being wedged into a tool rather than the tool fitting the research. This course introduces students to humanities visualizations, using a programming language that let researchers prioritize their questions over the requirements of ready-made tools. Students will learn how to iteratively create plots and maps using the R statistical programming language, as well as how to manipulate data so that it can be visualized. Students will become familiar with the entire pipeline of visualization---from data manipulation to exploratory graphics to online interactive visualizations. In addition, the course will offer an introduction to Shiny, a framework for writing interactive websites with analysis in R.
