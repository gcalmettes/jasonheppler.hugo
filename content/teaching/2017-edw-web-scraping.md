We often want data in a tidy format. While this often makes for a convenient and human-readable framework, data doesnâ€™t always come nicely formatted especially from the web. This hour-long workshop will provide a quick overview of popular methods for acquiring information/data from the web using R, with a focus on harvesting government data. No prerequisite software is required; a version of RStudio will be provided to participants via a server.
