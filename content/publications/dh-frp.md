Framing Red Power serves two goals. The first is provide access to newspaper sources related to the Trail of Broken Treaties and subsequent occupation of the BIA headquarters. Readers can search, browse, and manipulate machine-readable text. Furthermore, this project seeks to utilize textual analysis tools to explore how the media received AIMâ€™s message and how the activists used the media to construct specific images of itself and their goals. These issues give us a lens to understand the connections between media, politics, and imagecraft.
