This is a collaboratively-written call for the American Historical Association to appoint a task force to survey the profession as to the place of digital historical scholarship in promotion and tenure and graduate student training and to recommend standards and guidelines for the profession to follow. This document is a product of many of the exciting changes discussed below. It began at a session at [THATCamp AHA 2012](http://aha2012.thatcamp.org/schedule/) that included graduate students, tenured and non-tenured faculty, and librarians. These participants and others continued their conversations at the physical conference and afterwards on the web. Additional signatures and edits in the Google Doc were solicited via Twitter, and through posts on [Jason’s blog](http://jasonheppler.org/2012/01/13/a-call-to-redefine-historical-scholarship-in-the-digital-age.html) and by [Alex on GradHacker](http://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/what-counts-historical-profession). The letter was then submitted to the American Historical Association’s Research Division on January 26, 2012. On June 2, 2012 the [AHA announced](http://blog.historians.org/news/1664/decisions-of-the-aha-council-june-2012) the establishment of a Task Force on Digital Scholarship.
