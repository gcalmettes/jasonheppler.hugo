# jasonheppler.org

This is the code and much of the content for my website, http://jasonheppler.org. The site is created using [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/), a very fast static site generator written by Steve Francia. The present version uses the [Kube CSS framework](http://imperavi.com/kube/), takes advantage of a site design by [Greg Restall](http://consequently.org), and requires Hugo version 0.15 or higher.
